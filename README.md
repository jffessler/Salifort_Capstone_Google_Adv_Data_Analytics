# Salifort_Capstone_Google_Adv_Data_Analytics
Capstone Project for the Google Advanced Data Analytics Certification

This project is the culmination of a 7 course certification put together by Google. 
The project is addressing that the Salifort Motors senior managerial staff has been faced with the notable issue of high turnover in the company. The questions are where are the issues that seem to be the root of this endemic problem being faced? And is there a way to predict when an employee is in the group moving towards leaving the company via turnover?
The deliverables are: recommendations and insights as to why turnover is high throughout Salifort Motors and a machine learning model that will predict what employees are likely to be ‘turnover’
